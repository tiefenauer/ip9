\section*{Abstract}

This project researches how a simplified \textit{Speech-To-Text (STT)} engine can be used for \textit{Forced Alignment (FA)} of audio and text. The alignment was done using a global alignment algorithm. This algorithm operated on inferences from the STT model derived from chunks of the audio signal. It was shown that those inferences do not need to be high quality. Alignment of English text is possible with very low-quality inferences that can be produced by a STT trained on as little as 1.000 minutes of audio. Experiments with German data suggest that this will also be valid for other languages.
