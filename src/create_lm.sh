# create n-gram Language Model on ~2.2M German Wikipedia articles using with KenLM.
# The articles will be downloaded from the Wikipedia dump, which requires ~5 GB of free storage.
# The articles ar preprocessed by removing XML tags and quotes. Preprocessing requires uncompressing and will
# take ~3-4 hours and ~xxx of free storage.
# For a some statistics of Wikipedias see https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias
#
# Note: There is a blog post about creating a LM for English using the Bible. However, this blog post uses bzcat to stream
# the content of the compressed file and pipe it through a Python script for preprocessing. However, this is not a very
# performant way to train an LM since lmplz will complain with something like "File stdin isn't normal. Using slower read()..."
# To maximize performance, this scripts writes the preprocessed data is written to disk and read from there.
#
# Positional arguments:
#   N: defines the order of the n-gram model. Default=2
# Flags:
#  -r or --remove_files: Whether to remove artifacts after processing. Default=false. NOTE: If set to true the script will
#                        need to download and preprocess the files again if a model of different order should be trained
#                        on the same data! Downloading and preprocessing require approximately xxx hours!
