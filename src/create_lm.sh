# create n-gram Language Model on ~2.2M German Wikipedia articles using with KenLM.
# For a some statistics of Wikipedias see https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias
# The articles will be downloaded as Wikipedia dump, (~5-6 GB) and preprocessed to plaintext.
# The whole process will take several hours and requires ~25GB free storage.
#
# This script will perform the following steps (created artifacts in brackets)
# 1) download the dump file ({language}wiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2)
# 2) convert the articles to raw corpus file (wiki_{language}.txt)
# 4) create a vocabulary for the unique words in the dump (wiki_{language}.words)
# 5) train a n-gram KenLM model (wiki_{language}_n_gram.arpa and wiki_{language}_n_gram.klm, where n denotes the order of the LM)
#
# Note 1: to convert a Wikipedia dump to text there is a tool called Wiki Parser (https://dizzylogic.com/wiki-parser/)
# However this tool only runs in windows and cannot be used in this script. You can however use this script to generate
# a text file (articles_in_plain_text.txt) and place it in ./lm_data/wiki_{language}. The script will then use this file as base
# to create an input file for KenLM (KenLM expects the input file to contain one sentence per line, ending with a dot).
# If there is no such file, the Wikipedia dump is processed using Wikiextractor (https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor).
# However, this requires decompressing the dump
#
# Note 2: There is a blog post about creating a KenLM for English using the Bible (http://victor.chahuneau.fr/notes/2012/07/03/kenlm.html).
# However, this blog post uses bzcat to stream the content of the compressed file and pipe it through a Python script
# for preprocessing. However, this is not a very performant way to train an LM since lmplz will complain with something
# like "File stdin isn't normal. Using slower read()...". To maximize performance, this scripts writes the preprocessed
# data is written to disk and read from there.
#
# Positional arguments:
#   LANGUAGE: defines the language ('en', 'fr', 'de', ...). Default='de')
#   N: defines the order of the n-gram model. Default=2
# Flags:
#  -r or --remove_files: Whether to remove artifacts after processing. Default=false. NOTE: If set to true the script will
#                        need to download and preprocess the files again if a model of different order should be trained
#                        on the same data! Downloading and preprocessing require approximately xxx hours!
#
# example usage (create a 4-gram model for German)
# ./create_lm.sh de 4
# set -xe
