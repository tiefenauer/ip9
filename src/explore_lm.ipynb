    "The following model was trained for the Mozilla implementation of DeepSpeech and is included in [download of the pre-trained model](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech#getting-the-pre-trained-model). The model's vocabulary is contained in the file  (). The file `vocab.txt` contatins the vocabulary of the model (one word per line), which comprises also very exotic words and probably spelling errors and is therefore very big (973.673 words). To train the \\ac{LM}, $n$-grams of order 4 and 5 were pruned with a threshold value of 1, meaning only 4- and 5-grams with a minimum count of 2 and higher are estimated ([see the details about how Mozilla trained the LM](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/tree/master/data/lm)). Because spelling errors are probably unique within the training corpus, 4- or 5-grams containing a misspelled word are unique too and are therefore pruned. \n",
