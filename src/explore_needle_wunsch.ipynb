    "Glaring loopholes in our laws have allowed criminals and gang members to break into our country. For example, under current law, unaccompanied alien minors at the border are released into American communities no matter where, no matter how, it is so easy for them because the laws are bad and they have to be changed. This loophole is easily exploited by MS-13, which now operates in at least 40 states.\n",

When the boy’s mother tried to stop it, the gang member shot her in the head, blinding her for life. She’s lucky she lived, but she’s paying a very big price.\n",

Chain migration is a disaster and very unfair to our country. The visa lottery is something that should have never been allowed in the first place. People enter a lottery to come into our country. What kind of a system is that? It is time for Congress to act and to protect Americans. Every member of Congress should choose the side of law enforcement, and the side of the American People.
